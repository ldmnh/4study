strategy i combine my professional background in information science and my experience in innovative education to combine intelligent technology with innovation and entrepreneurship in the course we will discuss how to carry out innovation and entrepreneurship in the context of the advent of the intelligent era and how to integrate artificial intelligence technology into various industries the goal of the course is to enable more people to benefit from technological innovation and innovation and entrepreneurship \n\n\nwe summarize the course content into a model with two key points and three parts \n\n\nwe propose an entrepreneurial capability model in the intelligent era this capability model has five levels in total the first level is the ability of self awareness including the clarification of self values the exploration of the meaning of life and the clarification of vision and goals this is the first ability the second ability is innovation ability specifically it is the combination of innovative mental models and innovative thinking methods the third ability is technical ability which means understanding computational thinking and the ability to use intelligent technology to design products the fourth ability refers to business ability including management ability market and channel ability capital and industry experience and the fifth ability is the ability to work in a team \n\n\ntherefore our courses have two focuses the first focus is the cultivation of innovation and entrepreneurship capabilities our courses specially set up innovative ability cultivation modules to improve innovation capabilities through practical training methods specifically it is to improve innovation capabilities through the training of innovative mental models and innovative ways of thinking \n\n\nfor entrepreneurship we will take you to observe the whole process of entrepreneurship so as to tell you the truth about entrepreneurship at the same time it guides everyone to think about whether they are suitable for starting a business we can regard this part of the content as a general course on innovation and entrepreneurship which is suitable for all students to learn and this part of the content does not require any knowledge background in other disciplines \n\n\nthe second focus is technological innovation in the intelligent era we will discuss how to use intelligent technology to carry our innovation and entrepreneurship practices and how to integrate artificial intelligence technology into the industry this part is mainly from the perspective of technological innovation for example we will talk about computational thinking we will talk about machine learning we will talk about data technology and internet technology and we will talk about how intelligent technology is implemented in various industries \n\n\nthis focus will involve some mathematical knowledge and computer science knowledge considering that our course is a general course for all majors we will minimize the introduction of mathematics and professional knowledge and only give relevant technical background  we will try to explain it in an easy to understand way of course it will be helpful for you to understand the course if you have professional background knowledge \n\n\nthree parts of the course in the first part we will discuss the opportunities and challenges we face in the era of artificial intelligence this part has a preliminary discussion on the application of artificial intelligence to industries in the second part we will discuss the entrepreneurial capability model and focus on cultivating innovation capabilities this part corresponds to our first focus the third part will discuss technological innovation in the intelligent era especially computational thinking and machine learning technology this part corresponds to our second focus \n\n\nconsidering that this course is a practical course we have designed a project guide link at the end of each part through this link we can first help you solve the problem of topic selection and guide you to find innovative ideas with practical value in addition we will comment on some representative projects that i have directed in the project guide link through the explanation of the project we will have an in depth understanding of the project understand the content of the course\r\nin addition considering the practical nature of this course we will invite entrepreneurial mentors who have long been working on the front lines of entrepreneurship and investment to talk about innovation entrepreneurship and artificial intelligence in the last part of the project guide \n\nthe focus of the course is to cultivate the following three abilities the first is to cultivate innovation ability it means cultivating innovative mental models and ways of thinking understanding innovation in the intelligent era and having the ability to transform innovative ideas into innovative projects the second is to cultivate technical capabilities through the understanding of intelligent technology including computational thinking and machine learning we have the ability to transform innovative projects into products the third is to develop team capabilities we emphasize teamwork skills which are also necessary skills for starting a business through our innovative project training everyone can train their team skills communication skills and organizational collaboration skills in a group ",
