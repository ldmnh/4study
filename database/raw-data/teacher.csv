绘画是“心授于手”，不是“手授于心”。用心去画的人，就好比用心在唱，唱出喜悦，唱出烦恼。画出快乐，画出忧伤。用心，才会心心相印。用心，才会有心灵的沟通。画与歌，原本就是特殊的语言，是人类的母语，无需猜测、无需解释，通过她，人们能够感觉彼此的心声。自古以来，画与歌相伴，图与曲相生，歌中有画，画中有声。这不是经验、不是观念、不是道理，这只是身心的交融。不同的身心交融，形成不同的烙印，这烙印是情感，是思想，是精神，是心灵的歌唱。——李睦",t_li mu,li mu,"professor artist doctoral supervisor director of the oil painting teaching and research section of the academy of fine arts tsinghua university member of the academic committee of the academy of fine arts tsinghua university deputy director of the wu guanzhong art research center of tsinghua university lecturer of tsinghua universitys quality courses and the ministry of educations online open courses
